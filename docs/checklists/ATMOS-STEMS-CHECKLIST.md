# Atmos Audio Stems — Checklist

Provide 5 stems per theme (`mp3`, 44.1kHz or 48kHz):

- `public/assets/audio/<theme>/stems/wind.mp3`
- `public/assets/audio/<theme>/stems/water.mp3`
- `public/assets/audio/<theme>/stems/leaves.mp3`
- `public/assets/audio/<theme>/stems/birds.mp3`
- `public/assets/audio/<theme>/stems/pad.mp3`

**Mix Rules**
- Master starts at 0.6. Sliders set stem gains.
- Mood wheel warms/cools via shelving filters (±4 dB low shelf / ∓3 dB high shelf).
- Ducking lowers master ≈ −6 dB during narration/actions.

**QA**
- Loop points are seamless (no clicks).
- Stems complement; avoid frequency masking in 250–500 Hz region.
