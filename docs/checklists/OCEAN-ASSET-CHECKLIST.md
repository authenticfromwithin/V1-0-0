# Ocean — Scene Plates Checklist

Required plates (WebP, visually lossless):
- `public/assets/scenes/ocean/plates/back.webp`
- `public/assets/scenes/ocean/plates/mid.webp`
- `public/assets/scenes/ocean/plates/front.webp`

**Guidance**
- 1920w (or 2560w for 4K targets).
- Keep total size per theme ≈ 1.0–1.5 MB.
- Gentle grade; no cartoony saturation.
- Check reduced‑motion rendering — parallax will disable automatically.

**QA**
- No obvious seams between plates.
- Mid layer softens slightly (depth cue).
- Foreground accepts subtle translation at higher multiplier.
