February 22 â€” Keep company with the quiet good.

Breathe softly. Allow the body to arrive. You are welcome in this moment as you are.

Let the jaw release; let the shoulders lower. Nothing needs to be proven here.

Carry one small practice today: be kind to your own heart, then let that kindness travel.
