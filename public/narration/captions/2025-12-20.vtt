NOTE 2025-12-20 â€” Seedtime

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The dark as seedtime.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I settle my breath and release the need to hurry. Today, progress is measured in honesty, not in speed.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What I bless, blesses me back. I place a quiet blessing on my body, my space, and everyone I will meet.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Honest Rest becomes my simple liturgy: one attentive breath, one kind word, one unclenched moment.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If I forget, I begin again without insult. Beginning again is a sacred skill.

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Giver of gentleness, teach my body to trust the pace of healing. Keep me faithful in small things.
