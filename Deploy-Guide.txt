AFW v2.0 — Deploy Guide (Vercel via GitHub)
===========================================
Date: 2025-08-26

Scope
-----
Production deploy for Authentic From Within (AFW) — Vite + React SPA.
This guide assumes `npm run build` succeeded locally and `vercel.json` SPA rewrite is present.

1) Commit & Push (GitHub → Vercel)
----------------------------------
git add -A
git commit -m "AFW v2.0 live: build OK + aliases + ProtectedJournal + fonts resolved"
git push origin main

2) Vercel Project Settings (one-time)
-------------------------------------
- Connect GitHub repo (Import Project).
- Framework Preset: “Vite” (or “Other” is fine).
- Build Command: npm run build
- Output Directory: dist
- Install Command: npm ci
- Node.js Version: 22.x  (Project Settings → General → Node.js Version)
- SPA rewrite: vercel.json already in repo (QA passed). No changes needed.

3) Trigger Deploy
-----------------
- Push to `main` triggers automatic build and deploy.
- On Vercel dashboard, confirm the build completes; open Preview → then Promote to Production (or auto if set).

4) Smoke Test (Production URL)
------------------------------
- `/` (Home): parallax plates, reduced-motion compliant, ThemeToggle.
- `/healing`: avatar player (idle/walk/sit_pray), Intent controls, **ProtectedJournal** loads, clipboard/drag/context blocked inside journal.
- `/journey`: avatar states + Mood Wheel adjusts atmos “EQ tilt”.
- `/devotionals`: list renders from manifest; captions show; audio optional.
- `/quotes`: curated lists render from manifest.
- Refresh deep links: open `/healing` directly → should load (SPA rewrite verified).
- Audio: stems mix correctly; ducking on actions.
- A11y quick pass: focus outlines visible, skip link present, captions on.

5) Post-Launch (optional polish)
--------------------------------
- Audio size pass: re-encode stems (CBR→VBR) to shave MB without quality loss.
- Wardrobe tiles grid: ship variant thumbnails (already wired) and LUT tune set.
- CSP tightening: apply strict Content-Security-Policy after first live verification.
- Monitoring: add simple client-side error reporter (console → local ring buffer).

Notes
-----
- Journaling is **browser-only** (IndexedDB) and never leaves the device.
- No uploads/copy/paste inside protected spaces by design.
- fonts.css now resolves cleanly; Greek/Hebrew captions display.
